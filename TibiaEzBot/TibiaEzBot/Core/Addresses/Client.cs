            Several notes are needed on this one.
            1) This address is in the stack so it is very volitile. However it appears
               that it does not change as long as the player stays logged in.
            2) This address is always in the same place as long as the player
               is logged in.
            3) This address points to another address. Once you obtain that address
               you must add 0x4E and that will point to the begining of the struct.
